# learn you a system
A soon to be web application that teaches users a bit about how computer systems work :-)

The core of the web application is a compiler I wrote which you can find [here](https://github.com/jobhdez/pyhs).

# Web service

To run the web service, you need to:

```
$ cabal build
$ cabal run web-service
```

Thanks!
